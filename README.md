# Etch-a-Sketch

This project was built as a part of The Odin Project. I added some extras to make it more fun. 

The assignment was to: 

- build a mixed version of a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch
- practice DOM manipulation
- create a webpage with a (resizable) 16x16 grid of square divs
- use Flexbox for practice (not Grid on purpose)
