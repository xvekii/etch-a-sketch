# Etch-a-Sketch

This project was built as a part of The Odin Project. 
I added some extras to make it more fun.

## The assignment was to:

- build a mixed version of a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch
- practice DOM manipulation
- create a webpage with a (resizable) 16x16 grid of square divs
- set up a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail
- use Flexbox (not Grid) for practice
